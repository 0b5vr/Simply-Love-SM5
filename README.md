Requirements:
-------------
You'll need to be running StepMania 5 beta 2a or newer to run this port.



TODO:

**STUFF THAT IS BROKEN**

* Course Mode (pretty much everything)


**MISSING FEATURES**

* ScreenEvaluationSummary (lacks pagination)
* ScreenNameEntry (done enough) (but should ideally be re-written to allow RepeatingInput)
* ScreenGameOver (lacks player stats)
* score vocalization


**NICE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT**

* Make ScreenSelectPlayMode change "demonstrations" to refelect pump and techno modes (requires additional graphics)
* setting long/marathon cutoff lengths via this menu like oITG
* setting per-screen MenuTimers via a menu
