Simply Love (SM5 Port)
======================

This is a recreation of hurtpiggypig's Simply Love SM3.95 theme made to now run in StepMania 5.

For information on the original StepMania 3.95 version of Simply Love, check here:

Requirements:
-------------
You'll need to be running StepMania 5 beta 2a or newer to run this port.



TODO:
-----

* Help Text strings are often unhelpful or altogether incorrect and need to be revised.

**MISSING FEATURES**

* ScreenEvaluationSummary (lacks pagination)
* ScreenNameEntry (done enough) (but should ideally be re-written to allow RepeatingInput)
* Score vocalization
* Combos don't carry over from song to song.

**NICE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT**

* Make ScreenSelectPlayMode change "demonstrations" to reflect pump and techno modes (requires additional graphics)
* setting long/marathon cutoff lengths via this menu like oITG
* setting per-screen MenuTimers via a menu

**BUGS**

* Songs with multiple edit charts (ie. Tachyon Alpha/Delta Max) cause the custom StepsDisplayList to behave erratically
* Local profiles don't load/save custom gameplay modifiers (ScreenFilter, Judgment Graphic, Mini, SpeedMod Type)
