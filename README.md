Requirements:

You'll need to be running an up-to-date nightly build of StepMania 5 to run this port.  This will not work with StepMania 5 beta 3.



TODO:

**MISSING FEATURES**

* ghost data
* timed sets
* surround lifebar for ScreenGameplay

**NICE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT**

* set long/marathon cutoff lengths via Operator Menu like oITG
* set per-screen MenuTimers via Operator Menu
* ~~reimplement Screen Resolution and Aspect Ratio OptionRows to make more sense~~ this is not going to happen short of an engine overhaul

**KNOWN BUGS**

* Custom DifficultyList breaks with certain combinations of edits
* ~~CourseMode MusicWheel lags~~ this is engine-side
