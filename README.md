TODO:

**MISSING FEATURES**

* Score vocalization (should be optional via directory detection, ideally)
* DQ'd from Ranking with specific modifiers
* Speed modifiers should scale appropriately with music rate mods

**NICE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT**

* Make ScreenSelectPlayMode change "demonstrations" to reflect pump and techno modes (requires additional graphics)
* setting long/marathon cutoff lengths via this menu like oITG
* setting per-screen MenuTimers via a menu
* reimplement Screen Resolution and Aspect Ratio OptionRows to make more sense

**KNOWN BUGS**

* ScreenRanking2 currently doesn't populate with any course scores
* CourseMode MusicWheel lags
