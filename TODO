SIMPLY LOVE (SM5 Port)

TODO:
----------------
STUFF THAT IS BROKEN
----------------
Course Mode (basically everything, ugh)



----------------
MISSING FEATURES
----------------
ScreenEvaluationSummary (lacks pagination)
ScreenNameEntry (done enough) (but should ideally be re-written to allow RepeatingInput)
ScreenGameOver (lacks player stats)
score vocalization


----------------
OPTIONS MENU STUFF TO LOOK INTO
----------------
setting long/marathon cutoff lengths via this menu like oITG
setting per-screen MenuTimers via a menu


----------------
NICE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT
----------------
Make ScreenSelectPlayMode change "demonstrations" to refelect pump and techno modes (requires additional graphics)
