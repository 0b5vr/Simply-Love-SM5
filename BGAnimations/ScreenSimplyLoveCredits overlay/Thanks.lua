			About="Lara designed the original Simply Love theme for StepMania 3.95/ITG in 2012.\n\nAt that time she wrote: \"The goal was to make a simple, easy to use theme with nice design and thoughtful features. I questioned absolutely everything that was default in the ITG2 theme.\" Indeed, it was a stark departure from other theming efforts of the time, and became an instant hit.\n\nLara is a world-class Pump It Up player, and has represented the US at WPF multiple times. Most recently, she has designed the UI for Rhythm Horizon."

He was also responsible for the Final Fantasy Tactics and Super Meatboy themes for ITG.\n\nMatt is probably best known for dance gaming inhumnanly fast (though, he assures me that he is, in fact, quite human).\n\nMost recently, he has led development efforts for Rhythm Horizon."

While virtually none of Moonlight is left in Simply Love at this point, it helped immensely in providing the examples I needed when getting started.\n\nfreem's sardonic wit, typically left via inline comments throughout Moonlight and SM5's source, helped keep me going."
