At night, the headlights
of cars passing by outside
traverse my ceiling.


Curled up on my side,
knees brought inward toward my chest,
I hear the house sigh.


Smothered underneath
the heaviest of blankets,
I feel it within;


the gnawing of an
internal emptiness that
picks at each second.


I ask the shadows,
can there be more to us than
words over Facebook?

I click send, but the
cursor continues blinking
indifferently.


It is this that I fall asleep to.
